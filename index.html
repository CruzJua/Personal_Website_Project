                <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Hey there, my name is <em>Juan Cruz</em> and I made this website. 
Hopefully it can serve as a face for my portfolio. A few things about me that should be noted, 
I can be very strongheaded whenever I feel like I have a good idea. This is not to say that I don't
cooperate well I just need for my input to at the vary least be heard.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Moving from me as a person we can dive a bit into my life, 
curently I am a full time student at Neumont College of Computer Science. I also work part time on the weekends 
as a server at Black Bear Diner. I grew up in a decent sized family with 5 siblings. As a kid I always knew I 
wanted to do somthing with technology, but I was never truly in a position to do that as for the 
majority of my childhood I grew up in a single mother household. This experience has instilled a lot 
of core values in my life such at family, freedom, and a drive to constanly impove my life style and
skills</p>
