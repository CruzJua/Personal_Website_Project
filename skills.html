                    <p>Java was the first programming language 
I learned when I started at Neumont. Overall I think it set me up 
well to continue learning more OOP focused languages and the type of 
projects I've done in Java have been very interesting and fun. </p>

                    <header class="skill-header">Python</header>
                    <p>Python is the language I feel most confident in by far
mainly due to how much I've played around with it. With python being my second
language I felt a lot more comfortable testing things out. It also helps that my
chosen degree has a heavy focus on python considering many AI models leverage it's
simple and lightweight framework.

                    <header class="skill-header">HTML</header>
                    <p>HTML is a language that I technically started learning back in
middle school, but I've never really counted it as my first language because I never 
truly used it past the one class. In the process of making this website which is my first real
HTML project I've learned a lot of interesting things about not only HTML but also JavaScript
and CSS. That being said this is currently the extent of my knowledge in this subject and the
only project I have to show off about it

                    <p>One of the few non-technical skills I have that is actually useful
would have to be the languages I speak. As of making this page I am only fluent in English 
and Spanish, but I used to be nearing fluent in French which is unfortunately  no longer the 
case, do to a lack of practice, that said I have recently started making an attempt to relearn
French and making sure I continue practicing the language.
