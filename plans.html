                    <p id="goals">My future plans can be broken down to a few simple steps.
The biggest goal/plan is to buy my mother a house and allow her to be able
to quit working. That is one of the biggest reasons I've chosen this field
of study over other fields I found interesting. I want to be able to support
family at least as large as my own without having to worry about it being
too big a financial burden. I want to be able to decide where i live and
be able to purchase a home in that place hopefully making me the first
person in my entire family to purchase a house.
                    </p>

                    <p id="game-plan">That's a lot to do and not a lot of how,
so how do I plan on doing this? First I plan on getting the first job I'm offered
within reason to get my foot in the door. I plan on gaining as much experience in said compony
to either move up and increase pay or to move onto a personal project that could turn into some
business. During all this I plan on saving money and investing to grow what I have. Ideally at
some point after buying my mothers house I will invest in real estate. All this should leave me
in an acceptable financial state.
